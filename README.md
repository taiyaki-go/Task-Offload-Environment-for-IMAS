#Overview
These are codes for simulating task offloading in a vehicle network.
We are researching IMAS (IMportance-Aware offloading Scheme), a task offloading method that considers task importance, and we have implemented an environment in this code to evaluate our proposed method.
The research is ongoing and incomplete.

#Contents
- simple_offload_env_v10_RL.py : This is code for a model that learns a task offloading environment where tasks of varying importance occur, based on DQN.
- simple_offload_env_v10_safeRL.py : This is the model code combining safeRL with v10_RL.py to guarantee the success of safety-related tasks even during training. This is intended to serve as the prototype for the proposed method, IMAS.
- vehicle*.csv : Data generated by the traffic flow simulator SUMO is stored here. It is used for simulations.
